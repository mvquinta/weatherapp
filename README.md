TOP - Weather App project

My version for The Odin Project (https://mvquinta.github.io/weatherapp/) weather app: 1+Weather App.

Live Demo ()

Main features:

- Using fetch to call Open Weather API
- Async and Await
- UI changes depending on weather of searched city

Made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Webpack to bundle it.

This project allowed me to learn and practice how to work with an API and with Async.

Feel that it deserves a better CCS work with better positioning and some animations.

For a potentially v2 version, that will definitely be one of the mais objectives
